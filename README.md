# Ants-Simulator

This project consisted in a simulation of ants populations.
The world was made up of ants, nests, several communities and crumbs (ants food).
The communities fought each other to keep themselves alive.
The objective was to realize how important each factor was in the duration of each ant community. Each community had several types of ants (each one had their “superpower”, for example, more vision, more movement speed, more energy, etc.)
